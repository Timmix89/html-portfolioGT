        <h2>A short tale about my career.</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to welcome you to my journey that has consisted of 15 years experience in my respective field. Hopefully you take the chance to become apart of this journey with me.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the young age of 19 I discovered a passion for mechanical engineering which resulted in leading me to the path of component engineering. I was trained under what I like to call my drill sergent to study and learn how mechanical machinery works and understand their purpose.

                My interest led me down a 15 year career path which at times could be extremely hard on me but I persisted and stuck it out thanks to my determination and interesting in mechanical components. I have been put down, picked back up, pushed through this difficult path and learned a lot along the way.

                I am a perfectionist which benefits not only my clients but my company too. I have learned all the tricks of my trade and implement them into my daily life inside and outside my work life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am looking forward to demenstrating my experiences with you.
